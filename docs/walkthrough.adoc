.On necessary operators
====
See link:../README.adoc[] for information on operators and other prerequisites that must be installed for the demo to run properly.
====

== Initial Setup

The following sections review the different windows and potential setup necessary prior to going through the different chapters of this walkthrough.

=== Demo Shell

. Go to the root of the `azure-devops-demo` directory on your local machine
. Run this docker command from that directory (so that all the remaining commands will be run from inside a container will all the necessary tools installed)
+
----
docker run -u root -it -v ~/.kube:/opt/app-root/.kube -v ~/.azure:/opt/app-root/.azure -v ~/.ssh:/opt/app-root/.ssh -v $(pwd):/opt/app-root/src quay.io/mhildenb/az-demo-shell:latest /bin/zsh
----
+
. Open a second shell offscreen, the `hidden shell` and go to the root of the `azure-devops-demo` directory on your local machine
. Run the same docker command from before
+
----
docker run -u root -it -v ~/.kube:/opt/app-root/.kube -v ~/.azure:/opt/app-root/.azure -v ~/.ssh:/opt/app-root/.ssh -v $(pwd):/opt/app-root/src quay.io/mhildenb/az-demo-shell:latest /bin/zsh
----

=== Windows

. Have one window of Chrome with the following tabs
.. Azure DevOps (already logged into your Organization, for example link:https://dev.azure.com/mhildenb[here])
.. Topology view of the Dev Project
. Have a second window with the following tabs
.. Topology view of staging project

== Demo: Create from Git

. Enter the git options per below:
** `git repo url`: `https://mhildenb@dev.azure.com/mhildenb/fmg-project/_git/eshop`
** `Git Reference`: `feature-fmg`
+

+
. *Builder*: Select the .NET Core builder and the `3.1-ubi8` builder image per the image below
+
image:create-from-git-2.png[]
+
. IMPORTANT: Make sure the deployment is called `eshop`.  You don't need to set an application group
. Check the `Add pipeline` option to create a Tekton Pipeline
+
image:create-from-git-3.png[]
+
. *Build Configuration:* Click on Builds link at bottom to review Build Configuration options and uncheck all the S2I options
+
image:create-from-git-4.png[]
+
. Click Deployments and add all the following from the `eshop-dev` secret (and as shown):
+
image:create-from-git-5.png[]
+
. Click `Create`.  You should be navigated to the topology view
. After the deployment is created in the `hidden-shell` run the following command
+
----
oc annotate deploy/eshop --overwrite "app.openshift.io/vcs-uri"="https://github.com/hatmarch/eShopOnWeb.git" -n $dev_prj
----
. Notice that the deployment is pending.  Click on the deployment and show the resource screen
+
image:initial-dev-deploy.png[]
+
. Click on the Pipeline under `Pipeline Runs`
+
image:pipeline-run-deploy-button.png[]
+
. From the Pipeline details screen, open the `Actions` dropdown in the upper right and choose `Start`
+
image:pipeline-screen.png[]
+
. The pipeline details screen appears.  All the defaults are fine except:
** `MINOR_VERSION`: This refers to the minor version of the dotnet sdk.  Choose `1`
** `Workspace`: A PVC has been created in the dev project for this.  Choose it
+
image:start-pipeline-details.png[]
+
. _Make so a window with the Topology view is shown so that the new deployment can be seen when the build is completed_
. Follow the logs from the *shell* as these are more stable than watching in real time in the UI.  To do so enter the following command:
+
----
oc project $dev_prj
tkn pr logs -L -f  
----
. Go back to the topology view and click on the Build badge that has since appeared with a green check
+
image:pipeline-badge.png[]
+
. Show the UI version of the logs
. Go back to the topology view and click on the Route badge
. Login and put something in the cart
.. We might show that the database will be shared between CRW and the code


== Edit in CRW

. Show the explorer
** be sure to open the `eShopWeb > src > Web > Controllers` folder to show the dotnet core structure
** Can also show the `Web.csproj` or `Startup.cs`

. Whilst the tools drawer is open, click `Seed Cache` to restore packages from a cache on the container
** This is a way of responding to the `there are some dependencies` popup
. When the `Seed Cache` task is complete open a terminal
. Show that you can log into OpenShift from the terminal
+
----
oc login $(oc whoami --show-server)
----
+
. Run some commands, but especially this one to prove that the environment has been customized to include the az cli

. Use kbd:[CMD + p] to open `_LoginPartial.cshtml` quickly
. Search for `Login` text and update with `Login HERE`
+
image:crw-login.png[]

. Show that one of the steps is `oc-db-seed.sh`
. Use kbd:[CMD + p] to open `oc-db-seed.sh` quickly
. Switch to the topology view of the staging namespace and show that there is only a database
. Back in CRW, run the following command in the terminal to show that the database still needs to be seeded
+
----
sqlcmd -S tcp:hplus-db.az-demo-stage.svc.cluster.local -q 'select name from sys.databases' -U sa -P 'yourStrong(!)Password'
----
+
. In `oc-db-seed.sh` uncomment the following lines to show usage of oc
+
----
# FIXME: Uncomment to access the oc command
# oc project $PROJECT
# oc port-forward svc/${DATABASE_SVC} 1433:1433 &
